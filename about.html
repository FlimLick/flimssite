                    <h2>All about me</h2>
                    <p>Hi im Ashton Clouse</p>
                    <p>I have been programing since I was 9 or basically when I got some grasp of a computer. I haves so been amazed on how these little laser etched sand devices (Silicon) can crunch number so fast that it seems impossible.</p>
                    <p>I have been mainly programming in C++ for a really long time. It was also the first programming language i started with. I'll tell you this it was <bold>REALLY HARD</bold>. It was not great choice but I don't what I was doing at the time. I slowly picked up python and realised it super slow for the things I mainly program.</p>
                    <p>After a year of doodling around I tried out Unity game engine and try to make some RPG's but didn't turn out so great cause you would be supprised how different C++ and C# is even though they have a similar name.</p>
                    <p>After a very long time of using Unity. I found the Godot game engine wich I immediately picked up on. It's a fast, bloat free and small game engine that is super easy to learn because it has it's own programming language called GD Script </p>
                    <p>It's like Python but a little bit more straight forward. I also know more progamming languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, F#, SQL, Python, C++, ASM x86 32-64 bit, GD Script, Ruby, Swift, PHP, and Rust</p>
                    <p>I also have a big intrest into music and audio engineering. I have found it handy for when im creating games and in general just how audio works alone. Im in a band called Sounds Of Absurdity witch is a great group that have been in since about I was 13.</p>
