                <h2>Photon Spaceway</h2>
                <p>This is a passion game project that I have been working on for a least a year now. It's a 3D space racing gaming with multiplayer and a full storyline with full modability. It is still currently under development with a great team I have gathered over a year.</p>
                <p>I am mainly a Lead Programmer and Director of everything for the game since I am the one that started it. I also make all the games soundtracks and sfx since that Audio Enginearing is my other Hobby. I'm plannng to release it in beta by the end of this year.</p>

                <h2>Carrier</h2>
                <p>This is Carrier. A chat program that has been made from the ground up from nothing. It is a UDP dependant chatting aplication that includes sending images, making group chat, server based hosting, and soon to be voice calls. This was a project I made because I was simply board in the middle of math class. </p>
                <p>The status of Carrier is alright. I meen after all I did make this in math class then continue it becuase I put to much effort into it. It does have G-Zip compression and server based encryption but there are some bugs a security issues that need to be assesed.</p>

                <h2>Drone Stuff</h2>
                <p>Let me introduce you to Drone Stuff.</p>
                <p>It's a little game that I also made when I was bored and have a lot of freetime. Its based off of a Garry's mod map called gm_bigcity. I was really trying to challenge myself to import a map from a completely incompatible game engine to into the game I personally use (Godot 4.0)</p>
                <p>I added the drone into the game because I was trying to figure out how impulse physics work in the game engine for Photon Spaceway. I like making other projects just to learn how a little function works only just to over complicate it and make a whole game based off that one function.</p>
                <p>It does have multiplayer and modding capabilities but it is really buggy. I also made a song for the relatively nice menu I built for it.</p>
